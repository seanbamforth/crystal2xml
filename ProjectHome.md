## Getting started ##

  * Contact Sean for access to the project. Even if you're not in the list of people, you can still grab the source code and get editing. Email your changes to the project moderator

  * There is a list of outstanding stuff in the Issues tab. Also - see the "What we need right now" section below.

## What we need right now ##

  * I'd like a bit of advise on how to set this up so we have the same code base, but it works with both VDF14 and VDF15.

  * Someone to document how to download and get working on the project. We're using Mercurial, and I don't know if I've set it up right. If not, I need to know, and it'd be nice to know how to fix it.

  * The Front End. We just need someone to make the front end pretty, and make sure that resizing, etc works. This is a tiny job - and would require very little time. Suitable for a beginner level programmer, or someone with little time on their hands.


  * Crystal Expert. We need a few people to make a start documenting what's in the RDC, and writing the stuff to interface into it. We can worry about linking back to the XML Outputter Later. This is suitable for a number of people who are happy chatting to each other, and advanced skills.
